#### 3. Project Background and Problem Statement
The Online Test Application system creates an application that enables users to provide online tests, review them, and display the results.
This system contains three main modules: Quiz, Review, and Result. The quiz section of the online test application accepts the questions in JSON format. The JSON file can be easily shared from the server in the pre-defined format. The application renders the test at the client-side.
The “Review and display result” section allows users to declare the results immediately. You can simply call another JSON with the answers in it and evaluate and display the results immediately.
The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible.
